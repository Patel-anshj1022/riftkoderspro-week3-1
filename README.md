Responsive Flexbox Gallery

This project demonstrates the use of Flexbox for creating a responsive image gallery. Each image has a hover effect with a responsive design.

- Flexbox Layout: Used properties like flex-wrap is to control whether the flex items (child elements of a flex container) should wrap onto multiple lines if there isn't enough space to fit them all in a single line.
                                       justify-content which Distributes the flex items with equal space around them.
                                       align-items is when flex items stretch to fill the container.
- Hover Effects: Added a scale effect on hover for interactivity and is shown when the cursor is moved on the image.
-@media in css styling refers to how to to apply styles conditionally based on specific characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width and height. and fits acording to the devices screen

Challenges:
i faced ensuring proper responsiveness across various screen sizes where i tried to change the screen size on browser and some parts of the page were left out but i used w3schools and found the solution.

Another challenge was flex box sizes and how to make them be viewed properly and i watched videos on how to adjust flex box get transition effect and also w3chools once again helped me .
