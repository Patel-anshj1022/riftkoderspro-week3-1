Responsive Flexbox Gallery

This project demonstrates the use of Flexbox for creating a responsive image gallery. Each image has a hover effect with a responsive design.

- Flexbox Layout: Used properties like flex-wrap is to control whether the flex items (child elements of a flex container) should wrap onto multiple lines if there isn't enough space to fit them all in a single line.
                                       justify-content which Distributes the flex items with equal space around them.
                                       align-items is when flex items stretch to fill the container along the cross axis.
- Hover Effects: Added a scale effect on hover for interactivity and is shown when the cursor is moved on the image.
